                <h1>Welcome to Henry Ty's blessed collection of projects!</h1>
                <p>I've had experience with Javascript since 2017 (using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>) and started putting stuff on this website in 2019. We've got a wide variety of things to play with like <a href="#games-panel">games</a>, <a href="#sims-panel">simulations</a>, and <a href="#ai-panel">AI</a>. Enjoy!</p>
