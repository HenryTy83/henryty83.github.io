//////// TJSVMTDHAA: The Javascript Virtual Machine That Doesn't Have An Acronym
By Henry Ty, XX November 2022
//////// Hardware specs:

//// 16-bit big endian Von Neumann architecture processor
registers:
    PC: program counter*
    SP: stack pointer*
    accumulator
    x, y, d: general purpose registers
    
    *accessed by hardware only

65536 ($ffff + 1) unique addresses (not including bank-switching)
Memory Mapped I/O

//// Memory Mapping:
0x0000-0xffff: working memory

0x0000-0x3ff0: program memory
0x3fee: Hardware interrupt address
0x3ff0-0x3fff: interrupt vector addresses
0x4000-0x7fff: general purpose use
< 0x7fff: stack
0x8000-0xafff: Peripherals 
    0x8000-0x87b7: screen display
        screen is mapped in rows from top to bottom, each row goes from left to right. each byte corresponds to a character 
        useable address space: 
        starting rows: 0x8000, 0x804e, 0x809c, 0x80ea
        
        interacting with the screen is done by writing two 16 bit numbers: control and data
        control: the first four bits set the flag, the next 12 are the color: 0bABCDRRRRGGGGBBBB
            A: clear screen
            B: bold text
            C: italic text
            D: underline text
            R: red channel (4 bit number)
            G: green channel (4 bit number)
            B: blue channel (4 bit number)
