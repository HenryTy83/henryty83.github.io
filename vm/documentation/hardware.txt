//////// TJSVMTDHAA: The Javascript Virtual Machine That Doesn't Have An Acronym
By Henry Ty, XX November 2022
//////// Hardware specs:

//// 16-bit big endian Von Neumann architecture processor
registers:
    PC: program counter*
    SP: stack pointer*
    accumulator
    x, y, d: general purpose registers
    
    *accessed by hardware only

65536 ($ffff + 1) unique addresses (not including bank-switching)
Memory Mapped I/O

//// Memory Mapping:
$0000-$ffff: useable memory

$0000-$7fff: RAM (Programs and temporary data)
$7fef-$7ffe: interrupt vector addresses (each bit in the interrupt register corresponds to a byte, which is jumped to on the interrupt)
$7fff: Reset vector: On startup, execution will begin at whatever address is stored here
< 0x7fef: stack
0x8000-0xafff: Peripherals 
    0x8000-0x874f: screen display
        screen is indexed starting in the upper left corner at 0. Addresses increase by one going right. 
        After the right edge, numbering continues on the left side of the next line
        Each byte corresponds to a character 
        
        interacting with the screen is done by writing two 16 bit numbers: control and data
        control: the first four bits set control flags, the next 12 are the color: 0bABCDRRRRGGGGBBBB
            A: clear screen
            B: italic text
            C: bold text

            D: UNUSED

            R: red channel (4 bit number)
            G: green channel (4 bit number)
            B: blue channel (4 bit number)
        data: any 16-bit unicode value
